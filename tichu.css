 */
/*
	This is the CSS stylesheet of your game User Interface.
	
	Styles defined on this file will be applied to the HTML elements you define in your
	HTML template (tichu_tichu.tpl), and to HTML elements you create dynamically
	(in tichu.js).
	
	Usually, you are using CSS to:
	
	1°) define the overall layout of your game
		(ex: place the board on the top left, place player's hand beside, place the deck on the right, ...).
		
	2°) create your CSS-sprites:
		All images of your games should be gathered into a small number of image files. Then, using
		background-image and background-position CSS properties, you create HTML blocks that can 
		display these images correctly (see example below).
		
	3°) ... anything else:
		It is really easy to add and remove CSS classes dynamically from your Javascript with
		dojo.addClass and dojo.removeClass. It is also easy to check if an element has a class
		(dojo.hasClass) or to get all elements with a specific class (dojo.query). This is why,
		very often, using CSS classes for the logic of your user interface allow you to do complex
		thing easily.
		
	Note: on the production platform, this file will be compressed and comments will be removed.
		Consequently, don't hesitate to put as many comments as necessary.
